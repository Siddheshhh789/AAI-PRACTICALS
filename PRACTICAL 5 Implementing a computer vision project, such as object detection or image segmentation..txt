# Step 1: Load the YOLO model (ensure that the model path is correct)
model = YOLO("C:/Users/Desktop/Yolo-Weights/yolov8n.pt")

# Step 2: Process the image using the YOLO model
results = model("C:/Users/Desktop/p5/imgs/1.jpg")

# Step 3: Access the first result (it contains detected objects and image)
# results[0].plot() automatically draws bounding boxes on the image

# Step 4: Resize the image for better display (optional)
resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (800, 800))  # Adjust (800, 800) to your preferred size

# Step 5: Create the OpenCV window with normal resizing option

# Step 6: Resize the window to match the size of the image

# Step 7: Display the resized image in the window
cv2.imshow("Processed Image", resized_image)

# Step 8: Wait for a key press and close the window
